# Ice Cream Ratings Analysis sxcs

## Overview

This Python script analyzes ice cream ratings data stored in a CSV file using the pandas library. It explores various visualization techniques to understand and interpret the ratings given to different flavors of ice cream.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- numpy library
- matplotlib library

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib` in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Download the 'Ice Cream Ratings.csv' file and place it in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the script 'ice_cream_ratings_analysis.py'.

## Description

- **Reading Data:** The script reads the ice cream ratings data from the CSV file using pandas, with the 'Date' column set as the index.
